What Are the U, S, and Ruby Elements Used For, and How Do They Work?

The unarticulated annotation element, or u element for short, is used to represent inline text that has non-textual annotation applied.

Here is an example of using the u element to highlight various spelling errors:

<p>
  You can use the unarticulated annotation element to highlight
  <u>inccccort</u> <u>spling</u> <u>issses</u>.
</p>
In the example, the words incorrect, spelling, and issues are misspelled. The default styling for the u element is a black underline underneath the text.

In HTML4, the u element was used for styling purposes. But in HTML5, the u element should only be used to indicate that text has non-textual annotation applied.

If you want to style a piece of text with an underline, you should use CSS instead of HTML.

The strikethrough element, or s element for short, should be used to represent when text is no longer accurate or relevant. Here is an example of using the s element to show the cancellation of an activity:

<p><s>Tomorrow's hike will be meeting at noon.</s></p>

<p>Due to unforeseen weather conditions, the hike has been canceled.</p>
In this example, the first sentence is crossed out because the hike was canceled due to weather reasons.

The s element should never be used just to show changes to a document. More appropriate elements in that case would be the deleted text element and the inserted text element.

The ruby element represents small text shown above or below the main text. It is typically used to show the pronunciation of East Asian characters. Here is the ruby element example from the MDN web docs page:

<ruby> 明日 <rp>(</rp><rt>Ashita</rt><rp>)</rp> </ruby>
The rp element, or ruby fallback parenthesis element, is used as a fallback for browsers lacking support for displaying ruby annotations.

The rt element, or ruby text element, is used to indicate text for the ruby annotation. This text is usually used for pronunciation, or translation details in East Asian typography.

While the ruby element can be used for other types of annotations, the most common use case is for East Asian typography.
