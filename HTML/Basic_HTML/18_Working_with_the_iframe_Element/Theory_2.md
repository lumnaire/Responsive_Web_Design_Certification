How Do You Embed Videos onto Your Page Using the iframe Element?

In a prior lesson, you were first introduced to the iframe element. In this lesson, you will learn more about how to work with the iframe element. This element stands for inline frame. It's an inline element used to embed other HTML content directly within the HTML page. That HTML content could be a video, map, another HTML element, or even other web pages.

Here's an example of embedding a popular freeCodeCamp course from YouTube. To see a different video, enable the interactive editor and change the src value to a video of your choosing.

<iframe
  width="400"
  height="400"
  src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PkZNo7MFNFg?si=-UBVIUNM3csdeiWF"
  title="Learn JavaScript - Full Course for Beginners (YouTube video)"
  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
  referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
  allowfullscreen
></iframe>

The src attribute specifies the URL of the page you want to embed. The width attribute specifies the width of the iframe. The height attribute specifies the height of the iframe. The allowfullscreen attribute allows the user to display the iframe in full screen mode. It's also a good practice to specify a title attribute for the iframe, as it's important for accessibility.

The allow attribute, on the other hand, lets you define what an iframe can or can't do. This is called an allowlist. In the above example, adding clipboard-write to it allows the embedded page to write items to your clipboard. Items in an allowlist can be separated by semicolons or spaces, and both can be used together.

Note that the video can come from anywhere. It doesn't have to come from video services like YouTube and Vimeo.

Don't forget you can also embed a map, another web page, or direct HTML within the iframe element. Here is an example of an embedded map.

Try interacting with the map by zooming in and out.

If you want to embed direct HTML within the iframe element you have to use the srcdoc attribute instead of src.
